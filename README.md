### 🧠 Features

* Manage a list of cars and their availability.
* Add and manage customer details.
* Rent a car and mark it as unavailable.
* Return a car and make it available again.
* Maintain a record of rentals with rental fees.
* Display customers’ rented cars before and after returns.

### ⚙️ How It Works

The program defines lists for cars, customers, and rentals.
Functions are used to rent and return cars.
Each car’s availability status updates dynamically.
Rentals are recorded with rental IDs, customer info, and rental fees.
